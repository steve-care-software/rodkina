# Rodkina is a network based data focused programming language
Rodkina is a programming language that focus on manipulating data.  It contains a built-in AST (Abstract-Syntax-Tree) engine that enables complex data lexing using a visual syntax, a parsing engine that helps convert an AST into a usable logic structure, an instruction engine that makes it easy to convert data into logic, a compiler that can easily convert instructions into an executable program and an interpreter that can execute a program.

It also contains a built-in database system that makes it easy to manage data on disk and then share it with other people using an identity system that enables a decentralized management of roles and permissions on these databases.  Therefore, the Rodkina users forms a network of databases that can be queried using the built-in query syntax of the language.

At last, the evolution of the language and the path of links between databases will be managed and voted on by the community, using a software written in Rodkina that use a decentralized database which form our DAO (decentralized autonomous organization).

### Naming convention
In this document, the name of the network of databases and the web of links it forms is named "WebX".  The DAO organization that we are building is named "Legit DAO".
