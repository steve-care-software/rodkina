# Rodkina is a network based data focused programming language
Rodkina is a programming language that focus on manipulating data.  It contains a built-in AST ([Abstract-Syntax-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)) engine that enables complex data [lexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) using a visual syntax, a [parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) engine that helps convert an AST into an [arbitrary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrariness) [logical structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_in_computer_science), an instruction engine that makes it easy to convert data into a list of commands, a [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) that can easily verify instruction's logic and form an executable [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) and an [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) that can execute a program.

It also contains a built-in [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) system that makes it easy to manage data on disk and then share it with other people using a [digital identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity) system that enables a [decentralized management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization) of [role-based access controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) on these databases.  Therefore, the Rodkina users forms a decentralized [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) of databases that can be queried using the built-in [query engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language) of the language.

The databases are state-based: each database contains a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) that represents the previous modification of its internal data.  Every time data is added, deleted or modified on a database, a list of [atomic transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)) are send to the database and a block of transactions is formed.  Each data modification is made using a transaction and each block of transactions represents an atomic modification of data, which represents a state of the database that can be easily navigated using built-in Rodkina's programming language syntax.

At last, the evolution of the language, the path of links between databases and the database interfaces will be managed and voted on by the community, using a software written in Rodkina that use decentralized databases and a human-usable interface which form our DAO ([decentralized autonomous organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization)).

### Naming convention
In this document, the name of the network of databases and the web of links it forms is named "WebX".  The DAO organization that we are building is named "Legit DAO".
