# Rodkina is a network based data focused programming language
Rodkina is a programming language that focus on manipulating data.  It contains a built-in AST ([Abstract-Syntax-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)) engine that enables complex data [lexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) using a visual syntax, a [parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) engine that helps convert an AST into an [arbitrary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrariness) [logical structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_in_computer_science), an instruction engine that makes it easy to convert data into a list of commands, a [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) that can easily verify instruction's logic and form an executable [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) and an [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) that can execute a program.

It also contains a built-in [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) system that makes it easy to manage data on disk and then share it with other people using a [digital identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity) system that enables a [decentralized management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization) of [role-based access controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) on these databases.  Therefore, the Rodkina users forms a decentralized [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) of databases that can be queried using the built-in [query engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language) of the language.

The databases are state-based: each database contains a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) that represents the previous modification of its internal data.  Every time data is added, deleted or modified on a database, a list of [atomic transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)) are send to the database and a block of transactions is formed.  Each data modification is made using a transaction and each block of transactions represents an atomic modification of data, which represents a state of the database that can be easily navigated using built-in Rodkina's programming language syntax.

At last, the evolution of the language, the path of links between databases and the database interfaces is managed and voted on by the community, using a software written in Rodkina that use decentralized databases and a human-usable interface which form our DAO ([decentralized autonomous organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization)).

## Naming convention
The name of the network of databases and the web of links it forms is named "WebX".  The DAO organization that we are building is named "Legit DAO".

###### Variable
The first letter of a variable must be a lower-case letter, then can be followed by any letter, lower-case or upper-case.  A variable can contain only one (1) letter.
```
// valid one-letter variable:
a

// valid variable where the second letter is upper-case:
aVariable

// valid variable where the second letter is lower-case:
variable
